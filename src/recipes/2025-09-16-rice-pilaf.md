title: Rice Pilaf
description: Jasmine rice cooked with golden raisins, toasted almonds, and spices. This is one of my family's go-to side dishes and has some really nostalgic RiceARoni vibes that I love.

## Method

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for **3–5 minutes**, until translucent but not browned.  
2. Add the rice and stir to coat each grain in the oil. Toast for **3–5 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until the rice just begins to take on a light golden color.  
3. Stir in the toasted almonds, golden raisins, turmeric, sugar, garlic powder, and [^1]MSG (if using). Mix well to coat the rice and bloom the spices.  
4. Pour in the [^2]chicken stock and gently stir to combine everything. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  
5. As soon as the liquid reaches a boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Simmer for **10–12 minutes** without removing the lid.  
6. After simmering, turn off the heat but leave the lid on. Let the rice steam undisturbed for another **10–12 minutes**.  
7. Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and finish with fresh herbs before serving.  

## Notes

- Don't peek while the rice is steaming — lifting the lid releases steam and can leave the rice undercooked.  
- The fresh herbs can be parsley, mint, dill, or a combination therof depending on your preference.

[^1]: MSG isn't strictly neccessary, but it rules and it gives this rice pilaf a little bit of a RiceAroni vibe that I love.
[^2]: I generally just use Chicken buillon paste like Better Than Buillon
