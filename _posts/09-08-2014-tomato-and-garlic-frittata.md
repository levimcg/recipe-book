## Indgredients
- 8 eggs
- 6 strips of bacon
- 1/2 quart of grape tomatoes halved
- 6 cloves of garlic roasted
- 1 shallot finely minced
- 1 big handful of spinach
- 2 TBspn olive oil
- A couple good pinches of salt
- pepper

## Method

1. Preheat your oven to 400° and line a large baking sheet with foil. 
2. Halve all of the grape tomatoes and place in a large bowl. Add one Tablespoon of the olive oil and a good pinch of salt—stir with your hands to combine. Whack the garlic cloves with a knife leaving on the skins. Place them on a sheet of foil and pour over the remaining 1 TBspn of olive oil. Wrap the foil over the garlic and into a loose ball.
3. Dump the tomato and oil mixture on one half and the baking sheet and the foil/garlic ball on the other. Roast both at 400° for 15 minutes or so, until the tomatoes start to brown a little. Remove from the oven and set aside. When the garlic is cool remove the skins and then smash and mince into a paste. 
4. Stack the six strips of bacon and slice them into 1" pieces and brown the it in a medium (12") skillet. This is the skillet in which you will eventually be cooking the frittata, so pick one that is tall enough to accommodate all of the eggs and other ingredients. Remove the cooked bacon to a plate lined with paper towels and let it cool.
5. Discard half of the bacon grease to a bowl. Save it for later and fry some eggs in it. It's amazing—**trust me**. With the other half of the grease, fry the shallot for about a minute until is starts to get fragrant.
6. At this point, grab a big handful of fresh spinach and add to the pan with the bacon fat and shallot. Fry the spinach until it's limp and combined with the shallot and oil. Remove the spinach, fat, and shallot from the heat, and set aside. Leave the remaining fat in the pan on medium heat.
7. Crack the eggs in a large bowl and whisk like you are going to scramble. Add the cooked bacon, spinach, shallots, tomatoes, and garlic to the eggs, and stir to combine. Don't worry if the ingredients are still hot. They shouldn't scramble the eggs, but if they do a little bit it's ok.
8. Make sure your pan is on medium heat with the remaining fat and add the mixture to the pan. Leave on medium head for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until the eggs start to curdle just a little. When this happens remove from the heat and place the skillet into your preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes until the frittata sets up and gets a little brown on top.
9. Take it out of the oven and remove from the pan to a cooling rack. It should come right out because of the bacon grease.

## Serving Tips
Cool the frittata on a raised rack so that it doesn't get soggy and serve with some [roasted potatoes](http://recipes.levimcg.com/sides/roasted-potatoes.html). This recipe is really great cold also. I usually make one on Sunday's and we eat if for breakfast on the go.
