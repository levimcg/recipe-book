## Method
1. Dice up the chicken breast into small cubes (about 1/2") and transfer to a large bowl.
2. Slice the grapes in half, quarters if they are really big, and add them to the bowl with the chicken along with the finely chopped scallions.
3. I usually just by whole roasted and salted cashews in a can. Measure out a cup, place them on your chopping board, chop them roughly then add them to the large bowl with the chicken, grapes, and scallions.
4. In a smaller bowl add the mayonnaise, lime juice, and curry powder and stir well to combine then add the mayonnaise mixture to the bowl with all of the other ingredients.
5. Stir everythig until it all comes together. Cover and refrigerate.

## Serving Tips
This chicken salad goes great with some toasted bread and a cup of soup. It would also work really great on a bed of spinach as a tasty salad.
