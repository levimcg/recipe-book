description: This is my go-to cheese ball recipe. It's super simple and totally delicious.

prep: 15 min
cook: n/a
ingredients:
  - 16 oz. Velveeta cheese (1/2 a big block)

## Method
1. Set cream cheese out at least one hour before starting. Once softened add to a mixing bowl.
2. Cute the Velveeta into 1" cubes and add it to the bowl with the cream cheese.
3. Add the diced onion and MSG to the bowl and stir well to combine[^1].
4. Form the mixture into a ball and roll it in the chopped pecans until fully coated.
5. Serve with Ritz crackers.

## Notes
I got this recipe from my wife's former co-worker Beth. It is the best cheese ball I've ever had—hands down. I once won a cheese ball making contest with this recipe beating out a contestant that spent close to $100 on their cheese ball.

[^1]: While you _can_ do this by hand, it's much easier if you use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.
