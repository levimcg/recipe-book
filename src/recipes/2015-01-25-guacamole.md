## Instructions
1. Scoop the flesh of the avocados into a medium bowl.  
2. Squeeze the juice of one lime (about 2 tablespoons) into the bowl with the avocados.  
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl and mix thoroughly.  
4. Adjust with additional lime juice and salt to taste.  

## Notes
The best way to make this is with a large mortar and pestle, or molcajete if you have one. It really makes a difference in the flavor. If using, start by crushing the garlic with a pinch of salt until it turns into a paste. Serve with your favorite tortilla chips or on the side next time you make [beef barbacoa](/recipes/barbacoa/).
