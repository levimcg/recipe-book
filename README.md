# Recipe Book
Website source for a collection of some of my favorite recipes, as well as some new ones I'm just trying out.

## About
I tend to tweak recipes every time I make a dish. Using Git and GitHub for version control seems like a great way to keep a record of recipes and how they change over time. I've also been looking for an excuse to play around with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosting sites using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## To-dos:
- add "Posted on" dates to recipes
- re-organize archive page, maybe icons for each recipe type?
- search capability
- Start adding illustrations for recipes
