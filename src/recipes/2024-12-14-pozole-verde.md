## Instructions

1. Put one of the poblanos, the tomatillos, and one of the jalape√±os under the broiler to char and roast for about 10 minutes.
1. Brown chicken thighs in a Dutch oven or heavy bottom pot. Once they've browned and leaving behind some brown bits on the bottom of the pot, remove and set aside.
1. Saut√© onions, poblano, and garlic in the dutch oven until soft. Deglaze the pot with a bit of chicken stock if needed.
1. Remove the tomatillos, poblano, and jalape√±o from the oven. Let them cool slightly and then put in a blender with a bunch if cilantro, a teaspoon of oregano and chicken bullion powder each. Blend until smooth. Add some water to loosen the mixture if needed.
1. Add the blended mixture to the pot with the saut√©ed veggies. Add the chicken thighs and simmer for 20-30 minutes until chicken is shreddable. Remove chicken and add the can of hominy. Shred chicken and add back to the pot. Simmer for 10 minutes to warm everything through.

## Notes

Serve this with a garnish of chopped cilantro, white onion, and fresh jalape√±os. It's also good with avocado and shredded cabbage. I usually make some [cornbread](/recipes/cornbread/) to go with it.
