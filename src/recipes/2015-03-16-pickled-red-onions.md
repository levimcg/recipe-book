## Method
1. Peel and slice onion into thin strips from pole to pole (not across the grain). And place in a jar with a tight-fitting lid. I use [This jar](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90227985/) from IKEA, the same one I use for [marinated olives](/recipes/marinated-olives).
1. At this point you could add additional aromatics like oregano, or garlic. More on that in the notes below.
1. Combine water, vinegar, salt, and sugar in a small sauce pan and bring to a boil and stir to combine ingredients.
1. Pour the boiling pickling liquid over the onions and allow to cool at room temperature.
1. Once cooled place in the refrigerator. They should last for about a month or two in the fridge.

## Notes
The amount of water and vinegar you need may vary depending on the container you use for your onions, but the amount of vinegar should always be equal to water. A good way to measure this is to fill your container up with half water after you've added your onions, dump that out into a measuring cup and then add the same amount of vinegar to your sauce pan before boiling.

These onions are great as a condiment on all kinds of tacos and sandwiches. The acidity really mellows out the onion-y taste and makes for really bright flavor that goes great with heavily seasoned taco meats. Feel free to experiment with adding garlic, cloves, oregano, or other spices before pouring the pickling liquid over the onions.
