## Instructions

1. Start with 500g of my all-purpose dough. You can find the [recipe here](/recipes/multi-purpose-bread-dough/). While your dough is proofing, heat 1/4 cup of olive oil in a small skillet. One warm, add the stick of butter and heat until melted. Once the butter is melted add the crushed garlic and chili flakes. Turn off heat immediately and sit to the side and allow to cool to room temperature.
1. Once proved and ready to use, divide the dough in half and then shape each half into a rough square. Cut the first piece of dough into 12 pieces. You're aiming for strips of dough that are about 1/2â€“3/4" wide and about 4" long. Tie each strip of dough into a knot and sit to one side. Repeat with the other half of your dough.
1. Add the butter olive and oil mixture, half the chopped parsley, and half the parmesan from the green can[^1] to a large mixing bowl and toss your knots in the mixture.
1. Arrange the coated knots in a 9"x13" baking dish. They should all be touching each other and somewhat tight-fitting. Allow to proof in a warm place for about an hour until the knots have almost doubled in size.
1. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 20â€“25 minutes.
1. After the knots come out of the oven and have cooled for about 5 minutes, brush with about a tablespoon of additional olive oil then grate some Parmigiano over the top and sprinkle with another handful of parmesan from the green can and the remaining chopped parsley.
1. Serve alongside some jarred marinara sauce of your choosing.

## Notes

You can get real loose with the amounts of oil, butter, and cheeses here. Feel free to drizzle the knots with some additional oil before and after they go into the oven. Follow your heart with the amount of cheese you're sprinkling on top. It's hard to overdo it here. These things aren't something you should be eating every day. They're for special occasions and get-togethers so go for it.

[^1]: The cheap stuff from the green can is really best here. Don't replace with just the fancy stuff.
