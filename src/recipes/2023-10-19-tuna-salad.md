1. Drain the cans of tuna and add them to a mixing bowl along with all of the remaining ingredients.
2. Mix until well combined.
3. Serve with crackers, make a tuna melt, or use it any other way you like tuna salad.

## Notes
This is my basic formula for any cold picnic-style salad‚Äîchicken salad, potato salad, egg salad, etc. All you need to do is swap out the tuna and maybe adjust the amount of other ingredients.

Make sure to taste and adjust for seasoning at the end. You may want to add more salt, or sweetness depending on your tastes. Maybe add more mayonnaise if you like it creamier (especially if using for potato salad). Try substituting fresh chopped dill for the parsley.
