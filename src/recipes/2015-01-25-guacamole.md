## Instructions
1. Peel the garlic and put it in the mortar and pestle with about a  teaspoon of salt. Crush the garlic until it is paste-like. It will sort of look like a mashed up banana.
2. Pit the avocados, remove the flesh with a spoon and dump it into the mortar and pestle with crushed garlic.
3. Add the lime juice and the start bashing it all together until it turns into a slightly chunky consistency.
4. At this point you donâ€™t want to crush up the tomatoes and cilantro so just use a spoon instead of the pestle to roughly mix them in before serving.

## Notes
If you really like lime juice squeeze the other half of the limeâ€™s juice and mix it into the guacamole before serving. Serve with your favorite tortilla chips or on the side next time you make [tacos](/meals/asian-pork-tacos.html).
