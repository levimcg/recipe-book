## Recipe Book
Website source for a collection of some of my favorite recipes, as well as some new ones I'm just trying out.

### About
I tend to tweak recipes every time I make a dish. Using Git and GitHub for version control seems like a great way to keep a record of recipes and how they change over time.

### To-dos:
- [ ] Add [tag pages](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/tag-pages/) for recipe types
- [ ] Add a static search using [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)
