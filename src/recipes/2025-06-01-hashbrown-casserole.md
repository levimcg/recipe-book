## About
Adapted from this recipe from [this one](https://preppykitchen.com/hashbrown-casserole/#recipe) I found online. I've modified some of the ingredient amounts to our family's taste, but it's very similar.

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350 then to a large mixing bowl add the frozen hash brown, onion, sour cream, cream of chicken soup, half of the [^1]shredded cheddar, salt and [^2]pepper. Reserve the other half of the cheese and the panko (if using) for the topping.
2. Mix the ingredients thoroughly and the put them into a 9x13" baking dish.
3. Top with the other half of the cheese and cover with foil. Place in preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes.
4. After 30 minutes remove the foil. At this point you can add the panko breadcrumbs if you want. Place the uncovered casserole back in the oven for 10–15 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbling.
5. Add some chopped chives or parsley for garnish.

[^1]: Please, buy a cheap block of cheddar and shred it yourself. The results are a million times better than using pre-shredded stuff.
[^2]: Use a lot of ground pepper. It's one of the things that makes this dish.
