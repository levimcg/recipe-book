## Method
1. Place the pork loin in a gallon size plastic freezer bag. In a separate bowl mix together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes and sugar then pour the mixture into the bag make sure to evenly coat the pork loin. Put the pork loin in a shallow baking dish and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, but 24 is better if you have the time.
2. After marinating, take the pork out of the fridge and preheat your oven to the highest temperature. Coat a large baking sheet in foil, place a roasting rack on top of the foil (you could also use one of those baking cooling racks for this), and put your marinated pork loin on the rack.
3. Put the pork loin in the oven, reduce the temperature to 375 F, and roast for 60-70 minutes or until the internal temperature of the pork reaches about 160 F.
4. When the pork is done take it out of the oven, cover loosely with foil, and allow it to rest for 15-20 minutes before you slice it.
5. While the pork is resting, heat your tortillas in a skillet on the stove. I like to heat min until they get a little bit brown.
6. Once the pork has rested, use a sharp knife to slice it really thin.
7. To make the tacos, stuff one tortilla with a bit of pork and then top with a TBspn of diced cucumber. Sprinkle with a little bit of the chopped cilantro, and then finish it off with a tiny squirt of Sriracha.

## Serving Tips
I like to just layout a big sheet of cooking parchment paper and  pre-assemble a bunch of tacos to eat family-style. Make sure to set out the cucumber, cilantros for anyone who wants to add more, and the Sriracha for anyone who likes their tacos spicy.
