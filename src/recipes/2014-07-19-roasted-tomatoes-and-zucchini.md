## Method
1. Mix all of the ingredients in a large bowl making sure the oil coats everything.
2. Pour on to a foil-lined baking sheet and roast under the broiler  for 15-20 minutes until the vegetables start to get charred all over. You may need to stir about half-way through the cooking so  that all of the vegetables get good and charred. 
_**NOTE:**_ You may need to go back and forth between the broil and back settings on your oven, just keep a close eye and make sure everything isn't getting too black.
3. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

## Serving Tips
This stuff is also great at room temperature, or even cold as a "salad". You can just eat it as a side dish, or spoon a little on some pieces of sliced baguette and serve as a starter.
