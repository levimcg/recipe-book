## Notes
I got this recipe from my wife's former co-worker Beth. It is the best cheese ball I've ever hadâ€”hands down. I once won a cheese ball making contest with this recipe beating out a contestant that spent close to $100 on their cheese ball.

[^1]: While you _can_ do this by hand, it's much easier if you use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.
