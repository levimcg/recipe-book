## Recipe Book
Website source for a collection of some of my favorite recipes, as well as some new ones I'm just trying out.

### About
I tend to tweak recipes every time I make a dish. Using Git and GitHub for version control seems like a great way to keep a record of recipes and how they change over time.

### To-dos:
- [ ] Add [tag pages](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/tag-pages/) for recipe types
- [ ] Design and build home/index page
- [ ] Design and build "About" page with new photo of Grandma's recipe book
- [ ] Rework logo and incorporate hand-drawn styles
- [ ] Continue adding images as you take new photos
- [ ] Remove references to "illos" in front-matter (no longer in-use)
- [ ] Add new "Method" list shortcode for more control over step-by-step list styling
- [ ] Refine color palette and create design tokens
